# Project Aquinas

The only tools a programmer will ever need:
1. a way to run software
2. a way to make software
3. a way to define software

To run software, you need an execution environment.<br/>
To make software, you need a compiler.<br/>
To define software, you need a programming language.<br/>

What about debugging you ask? 
Well that would be correcting your software's definition;
and that, for the most part, is on you! It'll be facilitated
by the project of course&mdash;don't worry.

Demo you ask? Either 
before August 2023 ends, or 
September 2023, barring life happening, there will be a
metacompiler demo! It will showcase the most basic features
of the metacompiler and programming language up to its most
advanced. The execution environment is a bit more of a pain
and will come later, so for now, we'll use what already exists.
