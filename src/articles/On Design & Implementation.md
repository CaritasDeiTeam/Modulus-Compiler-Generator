# On Design & Implementation

1. Let everything be designed and implemented according to its objective purpose, i.e., design according to principal effect, not intent.
2. Let every species be subject to genus in its representation as it is in reality.
3. Verify conformity of implementation to design such that implementation operates exclusively according to the design, nothing more, and nothing less.
