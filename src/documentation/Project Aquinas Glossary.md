# Project Aquinas Glossary

This glossary assumes proficiency in Thomistic Philosophy.

Terms are ordered logically in such a way as to build on each other throughout the course of this glossary, and this structure is likewise mimicked in the documentation for Project Aquinas throughout for ease of understanding, so this glossary can be navigated without strict necessity of jumping between different terms.

You will find various sections categorizing terms according to their species and appearance in the manuals from within this glossary.

1. *************paranym************* (noun): denotes a term whose idea is in contradistinction to another term’s idea.
2. *********arbitrary********* (adjective, paranym: deterministic): proceeding from that which is an efficient cause of unnecessary being **************in addition to************** necessary being.
3. *************deterministic************* (adjective, paranym: arbitrary): anything which is an efficient cause of necessary being only; equivalently, that which is not an efficient cause of unnecessary being. (It is metaphysically impossible to be arbitrary and incapable of deterministic behavior on account of the nature of arbitrariness.)
4. ********whatness******** (noun): essence
5. *****as-by***** (preposition): according to
6. *****state***** (noun): all that is predicable of a being in any instant of its subsisting.
7. **************representation************** (noun): an arbitrary subject-to-object relation in which a substrate has an arbitrarily defined relation to one or more arbitrary whatnesses.
8. ***********information*********** (noun): the logical being within a representation—the quantity of which determines the number of representations that are absolutely or relatively possible between two states.
9. ********behavior******** (noun): any physical, mathematical, or metaphysical action that belongs to a being according to its nature.
10. ******change****** (noun): the differentia of two states or of two differentia of two states, i.e. those accidents not common to both objects.
11. ******change****** (verb): to cause a logical or actual difference in the state of a being. 

A logical change occurs whenever any observable, non-substantial change takes place within the being.

An actual change occurs whenever an observable, non-substantial change takes place within the physical whatness of the being, or a substantial change takes place within the being itself (i.e., change in whatness of the being itself).
12. ***********persistent*********** (adjective): having the nature of unchangingness as-by a set of one or more arbitrary, ********temporal******** constraints.
13. *********transient********* (adjective): not persistent.
14. ****name**** (noun): a logical being of communication which is that whereby a thing is called.
15. *****************identifier***************** (noun): a name representation.
16. ***time*** (noun): that continuous collection of serial identifiers whereby each instant of being is uniquely assigned and referred to (inherits Aristotle’s definition of time: that which has respect to before and after).
17. ********overhead******** (noun): that cost of effort which is superadded in nature, i.e., cost of effort extrinsic to some behavior’s or collection of behaviors’ intrinsic cost of effort needed to execute it.
18. ***********in hardware/in-hardware*********** (adverbial phrase): an adverbial phrase denoting a procedure or collection of procedures implemented using hardware.
19. ***********in software/in-software*********** (adverbial phrase): an adverbial phrase denoting a procedure or collection of procedures implemented using in-hardware procedures and potentially other in-software procedures.
20. ****preemptive executing**** (noun): formerly called speculative execution, means any executing done in the anticipating of a future result of a currently executing procedure.
